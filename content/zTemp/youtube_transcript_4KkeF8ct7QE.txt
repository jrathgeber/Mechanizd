What's going on? Zena here. Own the
present. Shift your identity. Transform
your
reality. No matter where you are at in
life right
now. I don't know what your situations
are looking like and where you're living
and what is
happening, but you can change all of it
right now.
Soon as you realize the truth of your
being and what is actually happening and
this reality that you're
experiencing that you are in
fact living life and experiencing your
life through the veil of how you see
yourself, how you speak to
yourself. And as soon as you shift
that, as soon as you make a conscious
choice to say no
more, that I am
reality, that I am
everything. I am
everyone and I create everything into
existence by my own
self-concept because I am Christ
consciousness, the present moment, pure
awareness. We were born without an idea
about ourselves.
No past, no future, right? No
assumptions, no notions, no
beliefs, no ideas about anything. We
were pure, vast, real, raw, and
now until we were told a
story. And that
story we believe to be true about
ourselves. And that in fact creates the
reality experience. And you can shift
everything in your life right now. When
you
recognize the truth and the power of
what it is you are, you are the creative
process to that creates the reality that
you
experience through the veil through the
filter of your self-concept. And as soon
as you shifted, as soon as you put your
attention and your energy from doing,
achieving, striving, going to places,
trying to change things, recognizing
that we create everything, all of our
experiences, the way we see life, what
we attract,
everything through this inner
narrative. And it wasn't even our
choice. We never designed it. We never
created it. It was imparted onto us. No
choice in the matter until one day you
get to that point where you realize you
can live the most incredible life, have
everything, experience everything, live
in peace and
joy. When you abandon the idea that you
are a past, that you're a bunch of
ideas, notions, and assumptions, and we
stop giving this power over to this
inner
narrative and just be done with it.
Abandon
yourself. Abandon yourself to your
highest. Surrender completely to it.
Say, "This is who I am." And allow
that. Allow that to show you the
path to show you what needs to
happen. What a bundle of joy I
was with my mess and my energy, my aura,
and all that stuff I
gathered. And I thought I could change
my life. Impossible. Not for me.
And I don't care how old you are, how
young you are, where you're from, your
skin color, what's happened, what hasn't
happened, how many times you've tried,
how many books you've read, or whether
you have not read one book in your
life. Universal law is universal law.
And as soon as you shift how you see
yourself, how you speak to yourself,
your self-concept, recognizing that that
is the reality that you're
experiencing. And once we move away our
attention from outside and thinking that
this is who we are, reinforcing the very
thing that created our
experience. As soon as we shift our
attention away from that and we go all
in on being instead of doing and
achieving and striving, trying to change
our reality, utilizing that self-concept
that created everything into existence
to begin
with. When you put all of your focus and
attention to now being it, feeling and
knowing, that's why I say
KFC, you embody that version of yourself
that is already everything you're
looking for through knowing and feeling
yourself with conviction.
KFC to be it right now. Recognizing that
that is actually the filter through
which we experience life. who you
embody, your self-concept, your
identity. No longer will you allow a
past and everything that's happened to
dictate how you feel, what you believe
to be true. Because whatever you believe
to be true about yourself, whether it is
right now in front of you in your
reality, whether or not is it is your
experience right now, it doesn't
matter. If you stay with it, life has to
conform. Your reality has to always come
in line with how you see yourself. And
that's why when I do coaching, when I
help people, I always say you have to
shift all of your attention. Put all of
your eggs on one basket. And that is
from doing, striving, wanting, chasing,
not being it, reinforcing the whole
program to now putting all of your
attention to being, feeling, and knowing
yourself to be incredibly healthy,
wealthy, abundant, all of it, full of
joy. This is who I am. And just one day
at a time. One day at a time. And then
allow that to guide
you because your energy, your aura, it's
everything.
And my eyes are tearing so badly. People
think sometimes I'm crying, but it's I'm
reacting to something cuz everything is
blossoming blossoming right now and the
season's changing here in
Germany. Oh man, it's like I'm crying
all
day. But yes, embrace your power.
Recognize your truth. We were told a
story. This story only continues to be
real and the current reality that you're
experiencing because we keep telling
ourselves a narrative. We keep putting
our attention on our past, on what we
believe to be true, not recognizing that
that that creates
everything. And if you want to do one
thing, just one
practice, right before you go to bed at
night, your subconscious, especially as
you fall asleep at night, right before
you go to bed, it's absorbing how you
feel and how you see yourself and what
you say and your questions you ask, just
say, "No matter what has happened, thank
you that everything is working out
perfectly. Thank you so
much. Thank you that today everything
happened right on time.
Thank you that life it's sh is shining
its light on
me. Thank you that everything I'm doing
is working out perfectly. Thank you that
today I grew in health and wealth and
feel and know yourself to be that just
before you go to sleep. Spend a few
moments in gratitude. No matter what has
happened, you could have had the worst
day. Your subconscious is taking it all
on. Have fun creating this new version
for yourself and just surrender yourself
to it. Abandon yourself to your
highest one day at a
time. I'm wishing you guys a fabulous
evening. If it is evening time
there, please comment. I'll respond if
you like to work me oneonone. Link is in
the description. I love you guys. Peace.
So next time.
