I apologize, but I don't see an actual article file attached to work with. However, I can help you create an updated article about the stock market that incorporates:

1. Current market conditions
2. Recent stock movements and crashes
3. Trump's current market influence
4. Latest Federal Reserve actions
5. Global economic factors

Would you like me to:
1. Generate a new article with these elements
2. Help you modify a specific article you can share
3. Provide a template for updating stock market content

Please provide the article you'd like to modify or let me know which option you prefer.

From what you've shown, I can see the HTML structure you want to maintain, which includes:
- Title and meta information
- Multiple sections with headers
- Image placeholders
- Tables and lists
- FAQ section
- Schema markup

Just share the content you'd like me to work with, and I'll help incorporate current market context while maintaining this structure.
